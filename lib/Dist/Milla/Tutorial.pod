Dist::Milla::Tutorial - Milla HOW TO

=head1 WORKFLOW

=head2 Setup

Install Milla and setup your profile.

  > cpanm Dist::Milla
  > dzil setup

Setup command will ask you a simple question to make a basic
profile. If you already have set up C<dzil> before, this is common and
you can skip the process.

=head2 Making a new distribution

Now it's time to make a new distribution.

  > dzil new -P Milla Dist-Name
  > cd Dist-Name

At this point, you will have a really simple C<Dist-Name> directory
that contains your module file with as minimum boilerplate as
possible.

It is recommended to track your repository under git as soon as
possible, even before releasing to CPAN.

  # Init your git
  > git init && git add . && git commit -m "initial commit"

Now start writing your code, edit the docs, tests and manage CPAN
dependencies with L<cpanfile>.

  > $EDITOR lib/Dist/Name.pm t/dist-name.t cpanfile

You can test your code with a simple C<prove -l t>.

For the first time build only, you can make a test build to get some
boilerplate you want to keep in the git repository so that your github
repository looks great with README, as well as installable from git
using C<cpanm> or testable with C<Travis CI>.

  > dzil build
  > git add Build.PL META.json README.md && git commit -m "git stuff"

=head2 Making the first release

When you get confident and it's about time to ship to CPAN, use the
test and release command. Before doing so, make sure your git
directory is not dirty i.e. all changes are committed.

  > git commit -a -m "Done initial version"

Now, ake sure you have C<Changes> file ready and have a new entry
under C<{{$NEXT}}>, which will be expanded to the next version of your
module.

  > $EDITOR Changes
  > dzil test
  > dzil release

And your first release is done. The release is tagged on git and all
the changes atomatically made are committed to git as well.

Wait for PAUSE processing it and your module showing up on MetaCPAN in
a few minutes. Congratulations!

=head2 Making a maintainance release

You have new features, bugs, pull requests and get ready to make a next
version of your module. Great, making a new release is equally easy.

First, make sure all your code has been committed to git and there's
no dirty files in the working directory.

Then make sure to edit C<Changes> file and contain entries for the
next release under C<{{$NEXT}}>. You don't need to commit the change
to the C<Changes> file, yet.

Now, make a release!

  > dzil test
  > dzil release

The release command will automatically bump the version for you - if
you have C<0.10>, the next version will be C<0.11> by default, but you
will be prompted to confirm that version in case you need a major
bump.

This will update C<Changes>, C<META.json> and bump C<$VERSION> in your
mailn module. These changes made by Milla will be automatically
committed, tagged and pushed to the remote.

=head1 MIGRATING

This section describes how to migrate your current authoring process
to Milla.

=head2 Manually migrating from other build tools

=head3 Module Dependencies to cpanfile

First, move the prereq declaration from C<Makefile.PL> or C<Build.PL>
to C<cpanfile>.

The easiest way to convert existing dependencies to cpanfile is to use
the command line tool C<mymeta-cpanfile>, which is installed with
L<Module::CPANfile>. Run the configuration with C<Makefile.PL> for the
one last time, then run the C<mymeta-cpanfile> command:

  > perl Makefile.PL
  > mymeta-cpanfile --no-configure
  requires 'DBI', '1.000';
  
  on test => sub {
      requires 'Test::More', '0.86';
  }
  
  ...

You can redirect the output to C<cpanfile> if you like. It is
important to pass C<--no-configure> option here, since otherwise
modules like ExtUtils::MakeMaker will be included. It is not required
with Milla setup, since Milla knows which configuration tool
(installer) to use and include them in META files upon the
releases. You can leave that out from the C<cpanfile>.

If you decide to manually construct new cpanfile, the formt is mostly
compatible to L<Module::Install>'s requirement DSL.

  # Makefile.PL
  test_requires 'Test::More', 0.90;
  requires 'Plack', '1.000';

becomes:

  # cpanfile
  test_requires 'Test::More', 0.90;
  requires 'Plack', '1.000';

which is exactly the same. If you use L<Module::Build> or
L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker>, that will be more manual process, but
basically the same thing. See L<cpanfile> for the available syntax.

=head3 Remove boilerplate 

Next, remove unnecessary boilerplate files.

  > git rm {Makefile,Build}.PL MANIFEST MANIFEST.SKIP README .shipit

=head3 Create a new ini and edit configurations

Next, create a new C<dist.ini> with the following two lines:

  name = Dist-Name
  [@Milla]

the C<name = > line is optional.

If your work directory is named C<Dist-Name>, Milla will be able to
figure out that is your distribution name, so you can omit that line.

Next, Edit C<.gitignore> and add the following lines:

  /Dist-Name-*
  /.build
  !META.json

You're almost done, and your directory will look like:

  cpanfile
  dist.ini
  lib/Dist/Name.pm
  t/...

C<git add> the newly created files and commit it.

=head3 Make a new build

Now you're ready to make the first build.

  > dzil build

and if it was successful, you get a build in a directory called
C<Dist-Name-v0.1.0> under your current directory. They can be later
removed with C<dzil clean> command.

Also, new C<Build.PL>, C<META.json> and C<README.md> are added in your
working directory for git-friendliness. C<git add> them and commit it.

  > git add Build.PL META.json README.md && git commit -m "git stuff"

Now you're ready to roll a new release with Milla. Before doing so,
convert your C<Changes> file format a little bit, and make sure you
have a following header in the top:

  {{$NEXT}}
          - Change log entry for the next version

The C<{{$NEXT}}> is a template variable that gets replaced with the
version and date string, when you make a next release. This is almost
the I<only> change you're required to make in your code base.

Now, run the release command:

  > dzil release

to make a new release, in the same way described above for a new
Milla setup. When this is not your first release, the version number
gets automatically bumped by Milla, but you will be prompted if that
is exactly the version you want, and if you want a major version up,
you can specify to do so.
